It was a <adjective1> Halloween night when my friend <person_name> and I decided to explore the <adjective2> house at the end of <street_name>.  
Everyone said it was haunted by a <adjective3> <creature>.  
We <verb_past_tense1> up the creaky stairs and pushed open the <adjective4> door.  
Inside, the air smelled like <smell>, and we heard a <adjective5> noise coming from the <room>.  
Suddenly, a <adjective6> <object> flew across the room and hit <person_name> in the <body_part>!  
We screamed and <verb_past_tense2> out of the house, never looking back.  
To this day, I still have <plural_noun> in my room that remind me of that <adjective7> night.s
