# Fill-in-the-Blank Story Game (Python)

Created: July 16, 2025

This is a simple and fun **Mad Libs-style** Python project.  
The program asks the user for different types of words (like adjectives, animals, places, etc.) and then inserts them into a funny story.

# Features
- Interactive prompts for word inputs
- Automatically fills in a predefined story with the userâ€™s words
- Great for practicing `input()` and string formatting

# How to Run

```bash
python pig_story.py
